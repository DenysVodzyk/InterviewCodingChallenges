Interview Coding Challenges: 

- Maximum Possible Value - Codility:
 
Write a function solution that, given an integer N, 
returns the maximum possible value obtained by inserting one '5' 
digit inside the decimal representation of integer N.

- Remove Consecutive Duplicated Chars:

Create solution which will remove consecutive duplicated chars from given string (not case-sensitive). 
For example result should be "ab" from string "aAb".

- FizzBuzz: 

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to N. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

- Template Output:

Output the string based on the template provided. Substitute values in "{{ }}" with values from the Map provided.

- Two Sum:

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

- Reverse String:

Reverse a String with the help of two solutions.

- Stack Implementation:

Implement stack using array. API should have following methods: push(int item), peek(), pop().

- Number Occurrence Count:

Given an array of integers. Right a method that would return a map that consist of an integer with the number of its occurrences in the array.

- Third Maximum Number:

Given integer array nums, return the third maximum number in this array. If the third maximum does not exist, return the maximum number.

- ReverseInteger: 

Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then return 0.

- StringReverse: 

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s. Follow up: Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

- PalindromeNumber:

Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121 is palindrome while 123 is not.

- ScrambleGameString:
We have a list of letters, and we need to check whether the word can be created based on this list. Letters cannot be reused (we need to count the number of letters available). There is a wildcard, that can replace any letter.

- Number Of Repeats:

You have an array of strings (i.e. ["dog", "cat", "fish", "cat", "dog", "cat"]). You need to create an algorithm to return the string that is present in the array most of the time (i.e. "cat" in the case above).
