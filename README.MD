Interview Coding Challenges: 

- Maximum Possible Value - Codility:
 
Write a function solution that, given an integer N, 
returns the maximum possible value obtained by inserting one '5' 
digit inside the decimal representation of integer N.

- Remove Consecutive Duplicated Chars:

Create solution which will remove consecutive duplicated chars from given string (not case-sensitive). 
For example result should be "ab" from string "aAb".

- FizzBuzz: 

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to N. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”.

- Template Output:

Output the string based on the template provided. Substitute values in "{{ }}" with values from the Map provided.

- Two Sum:

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
